{"query": "What is the minimum distance required between separated ELV and LV circuits in the same enclosure or duct?", "answer": "50 mm, unless an earthed metal barrier is provided, or if specific insulation levels are maintained.\nClause 3.9.8.2, Table 3.9"}
{"query": "Is it acceptable to run active and neutral conductors in separate conduits if they are in parallel paths?", "answer": "No, they must be in close proximity to avoid induced voltages and comply with electromagnetic compatibility requirements.\nClause 3.9.8.4, 3.9.8.5"}
{"query": "When supplying a detached garage with lighting only, is a MEN link required at the garage?", "answer": "No, if it's part of the main switchboard's MEN system and has no distribution board at the garage.\nClause 5.3.3.2(b)"}
{"query": "Is it acceptable to run active and neutral conductors in separate conduits if they are in parallel paths", "answer": "No, they must be in close proximity to avoid induced voltages and comply with electromagnetic compatibility requirements\nClause 3.9.8.4, 3.9.8.5"}
{"query": "Is it acceptable to run active and neutral conductors in separate conduits if they are in parallel paths?", "answer": "No, they must be in close proximity to avoid induced voltages and comply with electromagnetic compatibility requirements. Clause 3.9.8.4, 3.9.8.5"}
{"query": "When is it acceptable to use a 1.0 mm\u00b2 conductor in general lighting circuits?", "answer": "It is acceptable to use a 1.0 mm\u00b2 copper conductor in general lighting circuits if protected by a circuit breaker not exceeding 10 A, and the installation meets all requirements for current capacity, voltage drop, and mechanical protection, as per AS/NZS 3000:2018 Clause 3.3.1.2."}
{"query": "Are two switches on opposite walls controlling the same light fitting allowed in domestic installations?", "answer": "Yes, when wired as two-way switching using correct switching arrangement. Clause 2.9.3.4"}
{"query": "Is it legal to loop a neutral conductor between socket outlets in a final subcircuit?", "answer": "Yes, if all connections are electrically and mechanically sound, and conductor sizes are compliant. Clause 3.7.2.5"}
{"query": "When must a switchboard be rated for 63 A", "answer": "When the maximum demand or main switch rating exceeds 63 A. Clause 2.4.3"}
{"query": "What is the maximum disconnection time allowed for final subcircuits supplying socket outlets?", "answer": "0.4 seconds for circuits not exceeding 32 A. Clause 1.7.4.2"}
{"query": "In what scenario is earth continuity conductor allowed to be same size as active?", "answer": "When conductor is \u226416 mm\u00b2 copper (or 25 mm\u00b2 aluminium), earthing conductor can be same size as active Table 5.1, Note 1"}
{"query": "can you run an unearthed metallic conduit in a ceiling space containing LV circuits?", "answer": "No, metallic conduits must be earthed if there\u2019s any chance they may become live, even if they\u2019re empty or not enclosing a conductor. Clause 5.4.3.1"}
