Its validity should be checked, in accordance with the requirements of Clause 2.5.4.2.\n2.5.6.2\tProtection afforded by separate devices\nThe requirements of Clauses 2.5.3 and 2.5.4 apply respectively to the overload protective device and to the short-circuit protective device.\nThe characteristics of the devices shall be coordinated so that  the energy   let through by the short-circuit protective device does not exceed that which can be withstood without damage by the overload protective device in accordance with Clause 2.5.4.5(a).\nCOPYRIGHT\nThe selection  of  protective  devices  shall  be  verified   by   inspection  [see Clause 8.2.2(c)(ii)].\nReliability of supply\nGeneral\nThe electrical installation shall be designed to provide a reliable supply by dividing the electrical installation into appropriate circuits and selecting protective devices with appropriate discrimination (selectivity) so that in the event of a fault occurring, the loss of supply resulting from operation of a protective device is minimized.\nThe selection and setting of protective devices shall be verified  by  inspection [see Clause 8.2.2(c)(ii)].\nCoordination of protective devices\n*\t2.5.7.2.1\tGeneral\nCoordination of protective devices requires consideration of both discrimination (selectivity) and backup (cascading) protection.\nDiscrimination (selectivity) between protective devices depends on the operating characteristics of two or more protective devices such that the protective device for the downstream circuit shall operate for a given fault current while the protective device(s) for the upstream circuit shall not operate.\nBackup (cascading) depends on the characteristics of each of the two devices as well as the behaviour of the two devices when operating  in series. This includes the energy let through when sharing the fault as  well  as the peak current withstand of the downstream device.\nNOTE: Manufacturer\u2019s instructions/data should be used where available.\nFigure 2.12 provides a generic overview of discrimination (selectivity) between protective devices.\nNOTES:\nDiscrimination (selectivity) is achieved when PD 1 remains intact while PD 2 clears a  fault on the load side. Thus supply is maintained to PD 3 and the remainder of the electrical installation.\nFor examples and detailed requirements of  compliant  time-current  curves,  see  Figures 2.13 to 2.18.\nDiscrimination (selectivity) need not apply where protective devices  are  in  series  on the same circuits such as in UPS connected supplies.\nFIGURE  2.12\tDISCRIMINATION/SELECTIVITY BETWEEN PROTECTIVE DEVICES\u2014GENERAL\n2.5.7.2.2\tSafety service circuit discrimination (selectivity)\nA fault current up to the level of an arcing fault current\u2014\non one safety service circuit shall not result in loss of supply to other safety service circuits; and\non the general electrical installation shall not result in loss of supply to safety services.\nDiscrimination (selectivity) shall be provided between protective devices up to the level of an arcing fault current, which is deemed to be in the range of 30% to 60% of the prospective short-circuit current in accordance with Clause 7.2.3.5.\nNOTE: An example of protective devices and the arcing fault current is shown in Figure 2.13.\n2.5.7.2.3\tGeneral supply circuit discrimination (selectivity)\nIn accordance with Clause 2.5.7.1, to minimize  loss  of  supply, discrimination (selectivity) shall be arranged between protective devices for outgoing circuits and the upstream protective device.\nCOPYRIGHT\nDiscrimination is achieved using a discrimination study, the ratios shown below or manufacturer\u2019s data and tables. Circuit-breakers with  curves  shown in AS/NZS IEC 60947.2:2015 Figure K.1, current limiting and reflex tripping circuit-breakers may require special consideration.\nDiscrimination need not apply above the arcing fault current Iarc which is deemed to be in the range of 30% to 60% of the prospective short-circuit current.\nDiscrimination need not apply where protective devices are in series on the same circuit such as in UPS connected supplies.\nRefer to Figure 2.13.\nDownstream devices shall be selected to discriminate (provide selectivity) with upstream devices, using time-current curves, in accordance with the following:\nCircuit-breakers Two circuit-breakers, connected such that C2 is the downstream device and C1 the upstream device, shall be selected:\nFor ratings of C2 greater than or equal to 800 A, discrimination shall be provided by a coordination study using manufacturer\u2019s data.\nNOTE: Curve references are found in AS/NZS IEC 60947.2:2015, Figure K.1.\nAllowance for tolerances on settings may be required. Refer to Figure 2.14.\nFor ratings of C2 greater than 250 A, and less than 800 A, discrimination shall be provided between overload curves.\nDiscrimination is deemed to be achieved if the overload setting of\nC1 \uf0b3 1.5 \uf0b4 C2, e.g. C1 1000 A with C2 630 A.\nRefer to Figure 2.15.\nFor ratings of C2 less than 250 A, discrimination is deemed to be achieved if C1 \uf0b3 1.5 \uf0b4 C2, e.g. C1 MCB marked C63 with MCB C2 marked C40 (i.e. both C curves).\nNOTES:\nISD is not available on MCBs and only available on some MCCBs with electronic trip units.\nWhere a circuit-breaker is installed for load limiting purposes, such as on submains, reliability of supply is not required.\nFuses Two fuses connected such that F2 is  the  downstream device  and F1 the upstream device shall be selected such that the characteristics of the devices provide discrimination (selectivity) on overload (see Figure 2.17).\nDiscrimination (selectivity) between HRC fuses is deemed to be achieved\u2014\nFor overload when F1 \uf0b3 1.6 \uf0b4 F2, e.g. 16 A with 10 A; and\nFor short-circuit when F1 \uf0b3 2 \uf0b4 F2, e.g. 20 A with 10 A.\nNOTE: Overload curves are those for times >0.01 s. Short-circuit data is based on the total I2t of F2 \uf0a3 pre-arcing I2t of F1.\nFuse and circuit-breaker A fuse and a circuit-breaker connected such  that C2 is the downstream device and F1 the upstream device shall be selected such that the characteristics of the devices provide discrimination (selectivity) between the overload curve and the instantaneous setting or short delay setting (ISD) of C2 and the time- current curve of F1.\nBack up fuses are not required to discriminate. For service fuses refer Note 5.\nNOTES:\nA coordination study requires the calculation of the prospective short-circuit currents, and comparison of the operating time of various protective devices, taking into consideration the actual current seen by each protective device. Manufacturer\u2019s data should be used to assess coordination (discrimination and back up) in the short-circuit area (above the short delay  or  Instantaneous setting of the protective devices).\nDetailed requirements for coordination (selectivity and back up) as well as symbols, figures and examples are given in relevant Standards as follows: MCCBs and ACBs\u2014AS/NZS IEC 60947.2, MCBs\u2014AS/NZS 60898.\nIf devices are to be installed above their rated short-circuit capacity, the backup protection (cascading) requirements for circuit-breaker or fuse selection needs to be determined from manufacturer\u2019s data. Discrimination (selectivity), when backup protection of a circuit-breaker is applied, is limited (partial) and the value needs to be obtained from the manufacturer.\nRefer to Clause 2.5.5 for other requirements for \uf0b3800 A main switchboards.\nThe electricity distributor should be consulted for  discrimination  requirements between installation protective devices and the electricity distributor\u2019s service protective devices. The curves and settings of service protective devices will be required. For example, a 100 A service fuse will discriminate with a 32 A MCB.\nDiscrimination requirements are not retrospective.\nThe following terms are used in Figures 2.13 to 2.18:\nIPSC\t= prospective short-circuit current (see Clause 1.4.43) Iarc\t=   deemed maximum arcing fault current (= 60% IPSC)  Ii\t= instantaneous setting\nISD\t= short delay setting", "metadata": {"clause_number": "2.5.6", "page": 10}}

Muscular contraction can result in inability to breathe. Infants may be more prone to this risk.\nSelection and arrangement of devices\nGeneral\nAny device for the provision of additional protection shall be capable of interrupting the part of the circuit protected by the device when an earth leakage current is above a predetermined value.\nThe load current rating of an RCD shall be not less than the greater of the following:\nThe maximum demand of the portion of the electrical installation being protected by the device.\nor\nThe highest current rating of any overload protective device on the portion of the electrical installation being protected.\nNo earthing or protective bonding conductor shall pass through  the  magnetic circuit of an RCD.\nRCDs shall be so selected, and the electrical circuits so  subdivided, that  any earth leakage current that may be expected to occur during normal operation of the connected load or loads will be unlikely to cause unnecessary tripping of the device.\nNOTES:\nTo avoid unwanted tripping because of leakage currents and transient disturbances, care should be taken to ensure that the sum of the leakage currents of electrical equipment on the load side of an RCD is significantly less than its rated residual current. RCDs may operate at any value of residual current in excess of 50% of the rated residual current.\nThe loading of the circuit should be such that the leakage current does not exceed one-third of the rated residual current.\nTo avoid excessive leakage current causing unwanted tripping where socket-outlets are protected by one RCD having a rated residual current not greater than 30 mA, consideration should be given to the number of socket- outlets protected and the nature of electrical equipment likely to be  connected to the socket-outlets.\nTypes of RCD\nGeneral\nRCDs shall  be  fixed  setting  RCDs  complying  with  AS/NZS 3190, AS/NZS 61008.1, AS/NZS 61009.1, or IEC 62423 and intended for use in electrical installations.\nCOPYRIGHT\nNOTES:\nThe following Notes apply to both Australia and New Zealand:\nCommon types of RCDs and their applications are described as follows:\nType AC  RCD (marked with the\tsymbol), for which tripping is ensured for residual sinusoidal alternating currents.\nThis  is  the general  type  used  in  Australia  but  is   not   used   in New Zealand.\nType A  RCD  (marked with the\tsymbol), for which tripping is ensured\u2014\nas for Type AC; and\nfor residual pulsating direct currents.\nType I RCD, for which tripping is ensured\u2014\nas for Type A; and\nwith rated residual alternating current not exceeding 10 mA with  an interrupting time not exceeding 40 ms at rated  residual current.\nRCDs with rated residual currents not exceeding 10 mA but with an interrupting time exceeding 40 ms but not exceeding 300 ms at rated residual current are treated as Type A devices and marked \u2018General Type, Not for Patient Areas\u2019 in  accordance  with  AS/NZS 3190, AS/NZS 61008.1 and AS/NZS 61009.1.\nType F RCD, (F signifying frequency; marked with the symbols shown on right), for which tripping is ensured\u2014\nas for Type A;\nfor composite residual currents, whether suddenly applied or slowly rising intended for circuit supplied between phase and neutral or phase and earthed middle conductor; and\nfor residual pulsating direct currents superimposed on smooth direct current.\nType F RCDs are intended for the protection of circuits carrying high frequency leakage currents such as those associated with frequency converters and electronic ballasts.\nType B  RCD  (marked with the\tsymbol), for which tripping is ensured\u2014\nas for Type A;\nfor residual sinusoidal alternating currents up to 1000 Hz;\nCOPYRIGHT\nfor residual alternating currents or pulsating direct currents superimposed on a smooth direct current of 0.4 times the rated residual current (Idn); and\nfor residual direct currents that may result from rectifying circuits.\nType S  RCD  (S  signifying  selectivity  and  marked   with   the symbol), a specially designed RCD for which tripping is ensured after a predetermined operating time delay corresponding to a given value of residual current.\nThe waveform of a fault current to earth can affect the operation of an RCD and should be taken into account for the selection of the type of RCD.

In some cases internal sealing should be provided.\nAn opening with less than 5 mm diameter of free space is considered to be a close fit. Therefore, any opening of 5 mm diameter or greater requires sealing with a fire-retardant sealant.\nWiring enclosures, such as conduits, having an internal free space of greater than 5 mm diameter also require sealing to stop any draft effect that could allow the spread of fire.\nCOPYRIGHT\nS E C T I O N\t3\tS E L E C T I O N\tA N D\nI N S T A L L A T I O N\tO F\tW I R I N G\tS Y S T E M

installed, or adequate shielding shall be provided, in accordance with Clause 3.3.2.2.\nNOTES:\nSheathed cables exposed to direct sunlight do not require further protection from UV radiation, unless otherwise advised by the manufacturer, as the sheath is considered to provide the necessary protection.\nBlack insulated unsheathed cables, e.g. aerial conductors, with UV-resistant insulation complying with AS/NZS 3808, do not require further protection.\nFor insulated unsheathed cables with insulation colours other than black, the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation should be sought, or the cable should be provided with a physical barrier to prevent exposure to direct sunlight.\nGuidance on the effect of direct sunlight on the current-carrying capacity of cables is given in the AS/NZS 3008.1 series. A correction factor for a temperature 20\u00b0C higher than the ambient air temperature may be applied.\nHazardous areas\nWiring systems installed in areas subject to explosive gas atmospheres and explosive dust atmospheres shall be selected and installed in accordance with Clause 7.7.\n3.3.2.13\tThermal insulation\nWhere cables pass through bulk thermal insulation they shall be rated for current-carrying capacity, in accordance with the AS/NZS 3008.1 series, by length of cable passing through insulation, as follows:\n\uf0a3150 mm\u2014using the \u2018in air touching a surface\u2019 rating.\n>150 mm to 400 mm\u2014using the \u2018partially surrounded\u2019 rating.\n>400 mm\u2014using the \u2018completely surrounded\u2019 rating.\nNOTE: In New Zealand, attention is drawn to the requirements of NZECP 55 for wiring and fittings located near conductive thermal insulation.\nCURRENT-CARRYING CAPACITY\nGeneral\nEvery conductor shall have a current-carrying capacity in accordance with the AS/NZS 3008.1 series, not less than the current to be carried  by the conductor.\nIn determining the required current-carrying capacity, provision shall be made for reasonably foreseeable changes to external influences, such as  the installation of thermal insulation in ceiling spaces and walls.\nWiring\tsystems\tin\tdomestic\tinstallations\tshall\tbe\tinstalled\ton\tthe assumption that thermal insulation in ceilings, walls and under floors, if not\ncurrently installed, will be installed in the future.\nCOPYRIGHT\nNOTES:\nAppendix C, Paragraph C3 provides a set of current ratings that may be assigned to circuits in typical simple installations as an alternative to compliance with the AS/NZS 3008.1 series. The ratings assign cable current-carrying capacities that are aligned with the current rating of  protective devices.\nNational building codes contain mandatory requirements for the thermal insulation of ceilings and walls in certain situations.\nThe AS/NZS 5000 series of cable standards provide higher operating temperature materials for some cable insulation than was the case with their predecessors.\nCurrent-carrying capacities for busbars and busways should be  obtained from the manufacturer. Information  relating  to  busways  is  given  in AS/NZS 3439.2 or AS/NZS 61439.6.\nOperating temperature limits\nThe operating temperatures of conductors shall not exceed the limits given  in Table 3.2.\nPolymeric cables with normal use temperatures below 75\u00b0C (see Notes to Table 3.2) are deemed not suitable for Australian or New Zealand conditions.\nTABLE\t3.2\nLIMITING TEMPERATURES FOR INSULATED CABLES\n* Refer to manufacturer\u2019s information. NOTES:\nThe types of cable insulation given in Table 3.2 are included in relevant\nspecifications, i.e. the AS/NZS 5000 series, AS/NZS 3191, AS/NZS 3808 and AS/NZS 60702.1.\nLower maximum temperatures will apply where materials used in the construction of the cables or in association therewith, such as coverings, sheathings, insulating sleeving on connections and sealing compounds, have maximum operating temperatures lower than the cable proper. However, the allowable operating temperatures for such materials shall not be exceeded.\nIf manufacturer\u2019s recommendations permit, cables may be installed in locations where temperatures lower than specified may occur.\nThe normal operating temperature of thermoplastic cables, including flexible cords installed as installation wiring, is based on a conductor temperature of 75\u00b0C. This is because of the risk of thermal deformation of insulation if the cables  are  clipped, fixed or otherwise installed in a manner that exposes cable to severe mechanical pressure at higher temperatures.\nV-90 and V-90HT insulated cables may be operated up to the maximum permissible temperatures of 90\u00b0C and 105\u00b0C, provided that the cable is installed in a  manner  that is not subject to, or is protected against, severe mechanical damage for temperatures higher than 75\u00b0C. Such applications also allow for cables to be  installed in\u2014\nlocations where the ambient temperature exceeds 40\u00b0C, e.g. equipment  wiring in luminaires and heating appliances, or in roof spaces affected by high summer temperatures; and\nlocations affected by bulk thermal insulation that restricts the dissipation of heat from the cable.\nThe current-carrying capacities for MIMS cables are based on an operating temperature of  100\u00b0C for the external surface of either bare metal-sheathed cables  or served cables. Higher continuous operating temperatures  are  permissible  for bare metal-sheathed cables, dependent on factors such as the following:\nThe suitability of the cable terminations and mountings.\nThe location of the cable away from combustible materials.\nThe location of the cable away from areas where there  is  a  reasonable chance of persons touching the exposed surface.\nOther environmental and external influences.\nThe minimum ambient temperature of use for MIMS cables depends on the cable seal used and manufacturer\u2019s recommendations should be followed.\nCurrent-carrying capacities determined in accordance with the  AS/NZS 3008.1  series do not take into account the effect of temperature rise on the terminals of electrical equipment that can result in the temperature limits of the insulation of cables in the vicinity of the terminals exceeding the limits specified in Table 3.2. In such cases reference should be made to warnings given in the electrical equipment Standards.\nConductors in parallel\nCurrent-carrying capacities for circuits comprising parallel multi-core cables or groups of single-core cables may be determined from the sum of the current-carrying capacity of the various cables connected in parallel  provided that the following requirements are met:\nCables shall be not less than 4 mm2.\nGrouping of cables shall not affect the cooling of each parallel cable,   or group, by the ambient air or the ground.\nThe load current sharing between each parallel cable or group shall be sufficient to prevent overheating of any cable or group.\nExample:\nEqual load current sharing may be achieved by the selection  and  installation of cables to give the same impedance for each cable in the  group. This condition is satisfied when\u2014\nconductors are of the same material and cross-sectional area with a minimum size of 4 mm2;\ncables follow the same route and achieve the same length;\nconductors of each parallel cable, or group, are effectively joined together at each end; and\nthe relative position of phase and neutral conductors in and between parallel groups takes account of mutual impedance.\nException: Unequal load current sharing between cables or groups may be permitted, in accordance with Part 1 of this Standard, provided that the design current and overcurrent protection requirements for each cable or group are considered individually. IEC 60364-4-43 provides further information on the conditions under which this is permitted.\nNOTE: The AS/NZS 3008.1 series provides recommended circuit configurations for the installation of parallel single-core cables in electrically symmetrical groups. The recommended method is to use trefoil groups containing each of  the three phase conductors and neutral in each group.\nCoordination between conductors and protective devices\nIn accordance with Clause 2.5.3, the continuous current-carrying capacity  of the cables shall be coordinated with the current for which the circuit is designed and the type and current rating of the overload protective device.\nTaking into account the different overload operating characteristics  for  fuses and circuit-breakers, one of the relevant following conditions shall be satisfied:\nThe current rating of circuit-breakers shall not be greater  than  the cable current-carrying capacity (IB \uf0a3 IN \uf0a3 IZ; see Clause 2.5.3.1).\nThe current rating of HRC fuses shall not be greater than 90% of the cable current-carrying capacity (IB \uf0a3 IN \uf0a3 0.9 IZ; see Clause 2.5.3.1).\nCONDUCTOR SIZE\nGeneral\nThe nominal cross-sectional area of conductors shall be not less than the values given in Table 3.3.\nTABLE\t3.3\nNOMINAL MINIMUM CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF CONDUCTORS\nExceptions:\nSmaller conductors may be used on subcircuits supplying socket- outlets, based on their suitability, in  accordance with this Standard,  and taking account of voltage drop, current-carrying capacity and reliability of connections.\nTable 3.3 does not limit cable sizes for extra-low voltage  or  switchboard wiring.\nNOTE: The size of unprotected consumer mains should be coordinated with the electricity distributor.\nNeutral conductor\nThe minimum size of the neutral conductor shall be as follows:\nSingle-phase two-wire circuit  The neutral conductor or  conductors of   a  single-phase consumer main, submain or  final subcircuit shall have  a current-carrying capacity not less than\u2014\nthe current-carrying capacity of the associated active conductor; or\nthe total current to be carried, where there is more  than  one active conductor.\nMultiphase circuit The current-carrying capacity of the neutral  conductor of a multiphase circuit shall not be less than that determined in accordance with the following:\nHarmonic currents Where a consumer main, submain or final subcircuit supplies a substantial load that generates harmonic currents, e.g. fluorescent lighting, computers, soft starters, variable speed devices or other electronic devices, the third and any higher order harmonic current generated in the equipment\nCOPYRIGHT\nshall be added to the maximum out-of-balance load to determine the current to be carried by the neutral conductor.\nFor this purpose the third and any higher order harmonic current  in the neutral conductor shall be taken as 100% of the highest load-generating harmonic currents on any phase.\nNOTES:\nA harmonic current load that constitutes not less than 40% of the total load on any single-phase is regarded as substantial.\nThe third harmonic currents (and odd multiples thereof) are additive to the normal 50 Hz current to be carried. Therefore, it may be necessary for the capacity of a neutral conductor to be greater than that of the associated active conductors.

Fault protection by means of automatic disconnection of supply is intended to limit this voltage.\nAutomatic disconnection is achieved by\u2014\nthe provision of a protective earthing system in which exposed conductive parts are connected via conductors or similar medium  to the earthed neutral of the distribution system; and\nin the event of a fault current or excessive earth leakage current  flowing in the protective earthing system, overcurrent or earth leakage current protective devices operate to  disconnect the affected part of  the installation within the specified maximum duration of  the prospective touch voltage.\nFunctional earthing (FE)\nEquipment may be required to be connected to the earthing system for purposes of correct operation rather than the safety conditions associated with protective earthing. In such cases, functional earthing conductors are not required to be selected and installed to withstand fault currents or to be identified in the same manner as a protective earthing conductor.\nExamples:\nFunctional earth (FE) connections fitted to certain types of RCDs to provide an earth for an alternative supply connection for the internal electronic circuit operation in the event of the incoming neutral connection becoming disconnected.\nConductors connecting cathodic protection systems or radio interference suppression devices to a separate earthing arrangement.\nCOPYRIGHT\nWhere a \u2018clean earth\u2019 is specified for data or signalling purposes in a particular item of electrical equipment, the manufacturer of the electrical equipment should be consulted in order to confirm the necessary arrangements.\nWhere required, for operational purposes, functional earth connections for data and signalling purposes should be insulated from all  protective earthing connections and conductors and should only be connected  together at one point, normally at the connection to the main earthing terminal/connection or bar.\nCare needs to be exercised to avoid unintentional contact between the two earthing systems.\nA conductor insulation colour for functional earth conductors has not been specified in this Standard. However, to ensure that functional earthing connections are made to the correct earthing system, a green or green/ yellow conductor identification shall not be used.\nIn Australia, for telecommunication system earthing, see AS/CA S009 for  the requirements for the colour and installation of a Telecommunications Reference Conductor.\nNOTE: Additional\tinformation\ton\tfunctional\tearthing\tis\tavailable\tin IEC 60364-4-44.\nEarthing for combined protective and functional purposes\nWhere\tearthing\tfor\tcombined\tprotective\tand\tfunctional\tpurposes\tis required, the requirements for protective purposes shall prevail.\nEARTHING SYSTEM PARTS\nGeneral\nThe protective earthing arrangement for an electrical installation providing protection by means of automatic disconnection of supply and connected to the MEN system of distribution shall include the following parts:\nProtective earthing conductors connecting exposed conductive parts   as required.\nMain earthing conductor.\nMain earthing terminal, connection or bar.\nMEN connection between the  main earthing terminal, connection or  bar and the supply neutral bar.\nEarth electrode.\nEquipotential bonding of extraneous conductive and other parts as required.\nNOTE: Examples of the parts of the MEN system of earthing are shown in Figures 5.1 and 5.2.\nThe parts of the earthing system shall comply with Clauses 5.3.2 to 5.3.7.\nCOPYRIGHT\nEarthing conductor material and type\nConductor material\nCopper conductors\nCopper earthing conductors shall be  of high conductivity copper and shall be in the form of\u2014\nstranded conductors;\ncircular braided conductors; or\nsolid conductors having a cross-sectional area not less than 10 mm2 and a thickness not less than 1.5 mm.\nExceptions:\nA smaller solid conductor may be used where permitted by a particular cable Standard.\nThis Clause need not apply where copper cable components, such as sheaths or screens, are deemed to be an earthing conductor in accordance with Clause 5.3.2.2.\nAluminium conductors\nAluminium conductors may be used as earthing conductors, provided that they comply with the following conditions:\nConductors of 10 mm2 or less shall be solid conductors.\nMinimum\t16 mm2\tconductors\tshall\tbe\tused\tfor\tmain\tearthing conductors.\nConnection methods shall comply with Section 3 of this Standard.\nInstallation methods shall prevent corrosion of the conductor and connections.\nConductors shall not be installed underground or in damp situations.\nException: Aluminium earthing conductors may be installed underground or in damp situations where designed and suitable for such use.\nOther materials\nMaterials other than copper or aluminium may be used as an earthing conductor.

GUIDE\n(Informative)\nB1 SCOPE\nThis Appendix provides an example of the general arrangement of electrical installation circuits and identifies the steps required to determine the essential circuit arrangements that affect conductor size and selection of protective devices.\nGuidance is also provided on the following:\nCoordination of the characteristics of conductors  and  protective devices for protection against overload current.\nAutomatic disconnection of supply to provide fault protection, including determination of maximum earth fault-loop impedance and maximum length of a circuit that will allow a protective device to operate within the specified disconnection time.\nB2\tCIRCUIT ARRANGEMENTS\nThe electrical installation is required to be arranged with an appropriate number of independent circuits to different parts, in  accordance  with  Clause 2.2.1.1.\nThe most common distribution arrangement for a low-voltage electrical installation is radial branched distribution, an example of which is shown in Figure B1.\nThe steps that should be taken to ensure correct circuit arrangements are   as follows:\nDetermine the required current-carrying capacity, in accordance with the AS/NZS 3008.1 series, for circuit conductors dependent on the method of installation and the presence of external influences.\nDetermine overcurrent requirements, in accordance with Clause 2.5. Overcurrent includes both overload currents and short-circuit currents (see Paragraph B3).\nDetermine voltage drop requirements, in accordance with Clause 3.6.\nNOTE: Guidance on the calculation of voltage  drop  is  given  in  the  AS/NZS 3008.1 series.\nDetermine the automatic disconnection of supply requirements, in accordance with Clause 5.7 (see also Paragraphs B4 and B5).\nCOPYRIGHT\nHV/ LV supply t ransformer by\u2014\ndistributor where external to premises; or\neither distributor or customer within premises\nSupply to main switchboard by\u2014 a) distributor\u2019s network; or\nb) ser vice l ine; or c) consumer mains\nMain switchboard\nSafety ser vice circuits\n(fire, evacuation and l i f ts)\nGeneral power, lighting etc.\nDistribution switchboard (mechanical ser vices)\nSubmains\nDistribution switchboard\nSubmains\nDistribution switchboard\nFinal subcircuits\nto pumps, chillers etc.\nFinal subcircuits\nto general lighting, power etc.\nNOTE: Alternative arrangements are permitted; however, this arrangement offers the following advantages:\nOne circuit only will be shut down (by fuses or circuit-breakers) in case of a fault.\nLocation of the fault is simplified.\nMaintenance or extensions to  a  circuit can be  performed, leaving the remainder of  the electrical installation in service.\nConductor sizes can be reduced at protective devices installed on  switchboards  to  suit the decreasing demand towards the final subcircuits.\nConversely, a fault occurring on one of  the  circuits  from the main switchboard will shut down supply to all circuits of related downstream distribution boards.\nFIGURE  B1\tEXAMPLE OF CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION (TO THREE LEVELS)\n(Symbols are explained in Table J1)\nB3\tPROTECTION AGAINST OVERCURRENT\nB3.1\tGeneral\nThe term \u2018overcurrent\u2019 includes both overload current and short-circuit current.\nThe danger to the system from overload currents is that the temperature of conductors and their insulation will rise to levels at which the effectiveness  of the insulation and its expected service life will be reduced.\nShort-circuit currents may be up to several thousand times normal current and will cause overheating and mechanical stresses of conductors and associated connections.\nNOTE: See Clause 2.5.4 and the AS/NZS 3008.1 series.\nClause 2.5.1 requires active conductors to be protected by one or more protective devices in the event of overload or short-circuit.\nThe protection of conductors by protective devices is shown graphically in Figure B2. The conductor is deemed to be protected if its damage curve, determined in accordance with Clause 2.5.4.5, is to the right of the time/current characteristic curve of the protective device.\nTime/current\ncharacteristic cur ve of a circuit- breaker\nTime/current characteristic\ncur ve of a fuse\nDamage cur ve of a cable\nCURRENT l\nFIGURE  B2\tTYPICAL OVERCURRENT PROTECTION OF CONDUCTORS\nB3.2 Coordination between conductors and overload protective devices\nB3.2.1\tGeneral\nClause 2.5.3 requires a protective device to interrupt overload currents and that the operating characteristics of such a  device satisfies the following   two conditions that are shown as Equations 2.1 and 2.2 of Clause 2.5.3.1:\nIB \uf0a3 IN \uf0a3 IZ\nI2 \uf0a3 1.45 \uf0b4 IZ\nCOPYRIGHT\nwhere\nIB\t= the current for which the circuit is designed, e.g. maximum demand\nIN\t= the nominal current of the protective device\nNOTE: For adjustable devices, the nominal current (IN) is the current setting selected.\nIZ\t=  the\tcontinuous\tcurrent-carrying\tcapacity\tof\tthe\tconductor (see the AS/NZS 3008.1 series)\nI2\t= the current ensuring effective operation of the protective device and may be taken as equal to either the\u2014\noperating current in conventional time for circuit-breakers (1.45IN); or\nfusing current in conventional time for fuses (1.6IN for fuses in accordance with the IEC 60269 series).\nNOTE: The conditions of the equations are shown graphically in Figure B3.\nConductor ratings\nl\nl 2\nCharacteristic of protective devices\nFIGURE  B3\tCOORDINATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CONDUCTORS AND PROTECTIVE DEVICES\nCOPYRIGHT\nB3.2.2\tApplication\nB3.2.2.1\tGeneral\nAs shown in Equations 2.1 and 2.2, a protective device functions correctly if\u2014\nits nominal current IN is greater than the maximum load current IB but less than the maximum allowable current IZ for the circuit; and\nits tripping current I2 setting is less than 1.45IZ.\nB3.2.2.2\tProtection by circuit-breakers\nStandards, such as  the AS/NZS 60898 series, require the tripping current  for circuit-breakers (I2 in Equation 2.2) to be less than 1.45IN, therefore, the condition of Equation 2.2 will always be satisfied. For circuit-breakers,  1.45IN is known as the conventional tripping current.\nB3.2.2.3\tProtection by fuses\nFuses complying with the IEC 60269 series have a conventional tripping current of 1.6IN, therefore, to satisfy the conditions of Equation 2.2,  the rating of such fuses should not exceed 0.9IZ.\nNOTE: The factor 0.9 is derived from 1.45/1.6.\nB4\tPROTECTION BY AUTOMATIC DISCONNECTION OF SUPPLY\nB4.1\tApplication\nThis Paragraph (Paragraph B4) provides guidance on the application of\u2014\nthe\tdisconnection\ttimes\trequired\tfor\tprotection\tby\tautomatic disconnection of supply;\nthe\tearthing\tsystem\timpedance\t(earth\tfault-loop\timpedance) requirements of Clause 5.7; and\nthe earth fault-loop impedance test outlined in Clause 8.3.9.3.\nB4.2\tPrinciple\nThe principle of protection by automatic disconnection of supply is intended to prevent a person being subjected to a dangerous touch voltage for a time sufficient to cause organ damage, in the event of an insulation fault.\nIn order to meet this requirement, in the event of such a fault, the circuit protective device has to interrupt the resulting fault current sufficiently quickly to prevent the touch voltage persisting long enough  to  be dangerous.\nIt follows that this method of protection relies on the combination of two conditions:\nThe provision of a conducting path, designated the \u2018earth fault-loop\u2019, to provide for circulation of the fault current.\nCOPYRIGHT\nThe interruption of the fault current within a maximum time by an appropriate protective device. This maximum time depends on parameters such as the highest touch voltage, the  probability  of  a fault, and the probability of a person touching equipment during a fault.\nNOTE: Acceptable limits of touch voltage and duration are based on a  knowledge of the effects of electric current on the human body described in the AS/NZS 60479 series.\nCondition (a) requires the installation of protective earthing conductors connecting all exposed conductive parts of the electrical  equipment  supplied by the installation to an earthing system, thus forming the earth fault-loop as shown in  Figure B5. The protective earthing conductors need  to be of appropriate size and installed in a sound and reliable manner, in accordance with Section 5 of this Standard.\nCondition (b) requires the installation of protective devices with appropriate characteristics as specified in Section 2 of this Standard.\nB4.3\tDisconnection times\nThe AS/NZS 60479 series defines two components that permit the establishment of a relationship between the prospective touch voltage and  its duration that does not usually result in harmful physiological effects on any person subjected to that touch voltage.\nThese two components are\u2014\nthe effect on the human body of electrical currents of various magnitudes and durations flowing through the body; and\nthe electrical impedance of the human body as a function of touch voltage.\nThe required relationship between prospective touch voltage and disconnection time is derived for the normal situation as shown in  Curve L  of Figure B4.\nFigure B4 shows the maximum duration that a person may be in  contact  with an exposed live part of a circuit for a range of touch voltages under normal conditions (Curve L).\nNormal situations were identified as having the following general characteristics:\nDry locations; and\nFloor presenting significant resistance.\nParticular situations, including damp or wet locations and those involving exposure to wet or bare skin, require touch voltages to be further limited as shown by curve Lp. Damp situations are covered in Section 6 of this Standard.\nCOPYRIGHT", "metadata": {"clause_number": "8.4", "page": 60}}

Alternatively, it may be determined by measurement.\nCOPYRIGHT\nReactance may generally be ignored for conductors of 35 mm2 or less  where the active and earthing conductors are in close proximity to one another. Thus, for such circuits, the current IA may be calculated using only conductor resistance by\u2014\nIA  = UO/(RPE + RL)\t. . . B1\nwhere\nUO = the nominal a.c. r.m.s. voltage to earth\nRPE = the resistance of the protective earthing conductor from the reference point to the exposed conductive part\nRL   =  the\tresistance\tof\tthe\tphase\t(active)\tconductor\tfrom\tthe reference point to the exposed conductive part\nA study was made of the influence of the variations in the different parameters on the value of the prospective touch voltage and the corresponding disconnection time.\nThese parameters are as follows:\nThe factor c that represents the proportion of the supply voltage available at the reference point during operation of the protective device. Depending on the circuit considered, this may vary  between 0.6, e.g. a circuit very far from the source, and 1.0, e.g. a circuit supplied directly from the source.\nThe value m is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the phase conductor compared to the cross-sectional area of the protective earthing conductor in the circuit considered.\nThe supply voltage UO may vary within the limits specified in AS 60038 in Australia, or IEC 60038 in New Zealand.\nUsing a mean value of 0.8 for the factor c and a ratio m of 1, values that  exist in most final subcircuits, the prospective touch voltage UT for a  circuit  is given by\u2014\nUT  = c UO m/(1 + m) = 0.8 \uf0b4 230 \uf0b4  1/2 = 92 V\t. . . B2\nthus\nUT = 92 V\nThis touch voltage approximates to a time of 0.4 s, according to curve L of Figure B4.\nTherefore, for hand-held equipment, the maximum disconnection time for a 230 V nominal a.c. r.m.s. voltage to earth should not exceed 0.4 s.\nDisconnection times up to but not exceeding 5 s  are permitted for circuits  not directly supplying portable or hand-held equipment for the following reasons:\n(aa) Faults in such circuits are less likely.\nCOPYRIGHT\n(bb) There is less likelihood of persons being in contact with equipment supplied by such circuits during a fault.\n(cc) Equipment supplied by these circuits is not usually gripped and can therefore be released easily if a fault occurs.\n(dd) Touch voltages are not expected to exceed the values set  out  in  Figure B4 for the time/touch-voltage relationship.\nThe time limit of 5 s does not imply intentional delayed operation of protective devices or touch voltages that are unsafe.\nWhere the conditions for protection by automatic disconnection of supply cannot be fulfilled by  overcurrent protective devices, such protection may  be provided by RCDs having a suitable tripping time. This may occur with circuits supplying socket-outlets, the length of which is unknown, or circuits of great length and small cross-sectional area thus having high impedance.\nNOTE: Maximum disconnection times will vary for other operating voltages or installation conditions. In particular, lower values of disconnecting time  and touch voltage may be required for damp situations or special installations, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6 and 7 of this Standard.\nB4.4\tThe earth fault-loop\nThe earth fault-loop in an MEN system comprises the following parts,  starting and ending at the point of fault (see Figure B5):\nThe protective earthing conductor (PE) including the main earthing terminal/connection or bar and MEN connection.\nThe neutral-return path, consisting of the neutral conductor (N)  between the main neutral terminal or bar and the neutral point at the transformer (the earth return path RG to RB has a relatively high resistance and may be ignored for an individual installation in an MEN system).\nThe path through the neutral point of the transformer and the transformer winding.\nThe active conductor as far as the point of the fault.\nThe earth fault-loop is normally regarded as consisting of the following two parts:\nConductors upstream or \u2018external\u2019 to the reference point.\nConductors downstream or \u2018internal\u2019 to the circuit from the reference point.\nFigure B5 shows an active-to-earth fault which, for the purposes of calculations, is deemed to be of negligible impedance.\nCOPYRIGHT\nAt the instant of  the fault, current will flow through the earth fault-loop and  its magnitude is only limited by the total system impedance Zs that is  obtained from all the individual impedances in the earth fault-loop  as  follows:\nZs  = ZAB + ZBC  + ZCD  + ZDE  + ZEF  + ZFG  + ZGH + ZHA\t. . . B3\nIn Figure B5, impedances ZAB, ZBC, ZFG, ZGH and ZHA are all upstream of the protective device within the electrical installation under consideration and  are regarded as being external to the reference point, hence, they may be collectively  referred  to as  Zext.  The  remainder   that   are   downstream (or \u2018internal\u2019) may be referred to as Zint, therefore, Zs = Zext + Zint.\nThis ratio is used to determine a suitable circuit length (see Paragraph B5).\nA\tFault current ( l A)\nH\nDistributor' s substation\nDistributor' s network\nL1 L2 L3 N\nSer vice l ine\nPoint of supply\nMain switchboard MEN connection Ear th bar\nG\nNeutral bar\nF\nB\nConsumers mains\nC\nR ph\nSubstation LV\near thing conductor\nR e\nMain\near thing\nconductor\tE\nReference point\nD\nSoil resistance between\nelectrodes relatively high.\nR B\tPropor t ion of current\tR G\nFaulty equipment\nmay  be ignored.\nNOTE: Although supply from a distribution system is shown, the same principle applies where the substation forms part of the electrical installation.\nFIGURE  B5\tMEN SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED)\u2014SHOWING FAULT CURRENT (IA) PATH (EARTH FAULT-LOOP)\nCOPYRIGHT\nB4.5\tCalculation of earth fault-loop impedance\nTable 8.1 contains calculated examples of the maximum values of earth fault-loop impedance, Zs, using approximate mean tripping currents, which may be taken as  IA  for a  limited  range  of  MCBs  (taken  from  the  AS/NZS 60898 series and manufacturers\u2019 time/current  characteristic  curves) and fuses (taken from IEC 60269.1) and the appropriate disconnection time.\nNOTES:\nThe appropriate tolerances permitted by the product Standard should be taken into consideration. Therefore, as part of the simplification process, approximate mean tripping currents have been used.\nSee Figure B6 for typical time/current curves for a circuit-breaker and a fuse.\nCURRENT, l\nCircuit- breaker\nCURRENT, l\nFuse\nFIGURE  B6\tTYPICAL TIME/CURRENT CURVES FOR CIRCUIT-BREAKERS AND FUSES\nThe values of Zs in Table 8.1 were calculated using the following equation:\nZs = Uo/la\t. . .

The measured impedance should not exceed the value given for Zs in Table 8.1 for the appropriate protective device and disconnection time.\nThe earth fault-loop impedance should be measured using an instrument  that has a facility for measuring and indicating low values of impedance.\nThe MEN connection needs to be left intact. Measurements can be made as follows:\nFor a submain, where the instrument is connected between  the  relevant active conductor and the main earthing terminal/connection or bar at a switchboard.\nFor a final subcircuit, where the instrument is connected between the furthest point on the active conductor and the corresponding point on the associated protective earthing conductor, e.g. at a socket-outlet.\nThe suitability of the  particular overcurrent protective device  depends on  the value of the earth fault-loop impedance (Zs).\nNOTE: Where the circuit protective device is an RCD, the measurement of earth fault-loop impedance is not necessary; however, it is recommended that such measurement be carried out so as to identify any abnormal circuit conditions   that may be present.\nB5\tMAXIMUM CIRCUIT LENGTHS\nB5.1\tGeneral\nThe information in Paragraph B5.2 may be used as a guide to provide a reasonably accurate assessment of maximum circuit  lengths,  in  metres, that will ensure the correct operation of the protective device within the appropriate disconnection time to provide fault protection, in accordance  with Clause 5.7.\nB5.2\tCalculation of maximum length of circuit B5.2.1\t\tDetermination of Zint\nAs stated in Paragraph B4.4, Zs = Zext + Zint.\nWhen an electrical installation is being designed, Zext may or may not be available (it will depend on the electricity distributor\u2019s transformer  and  supply cables). If it is not available, Zint may be determined by either of the following methods:\nWhen the length and cross-sectional area of conductors are known\u2014\nZint  = ZCD + ZEF\t. . . B5\nwhere\nZCD = impedance of the active conductors (C to D in Figure B5)\nZEF\t= impedance of the protective earthing conductors (E to F in Figure B5)\nNOTES:\nConsumer mains (ZBC and ZFG) form part of Zext.\nImpedances for conductors are given in the AS/NZS 3008.1 series.\nWhen the length and cross-sectional area of the supply conductors are not known, it may be assumed that there will always be 80% or more    of the nominal phase voltage available at the position of the circuit protective device. Therefore, Zint should be not greater than  0.8 Zs. This may be expressed as follows:\nZint  = 0.8 Uo/la\t. . . B6\nB5.2.2\tCalculation method\nThis method is only reliable where the conductors that make up the earth- fault-current loop are in close proximity to each other and are not separated by ferromagnetic materials.\nEquation B6 may be expressed in terms of circuit length by considering conductor sizes (active and earth) and protective device tripping current  (see Note 1).

For voltage drop loop length on distributed circuits, refer to Clause 3.6.2, exception 1.\nVoltage drop route lengths are for final subcircuits (e.g. 3%)  and  the  voltage  drop from the point of supply to the start of the final subcircuit must be added (e.g. 2%)     and not exceed 5% as required by Clause 3.6.2.\nThe earth fault loop route lengths for final subcircuits will satisfy the requirements of Clauses 1.5.5.3, 5.7 and 8.3.9 for automatic disconnection of supply for the conditions of Paragraph B5.2.2 and may be used for compliance of final subcircuits but must not exceed the voltage drop loop length.\nTo comply with both earth fault loop and voltage drop route length the shortest route length is required.\nFor example, the route length for 3% voltage drop, single phase  is  always less than the earth fault loop length and overrides the EFL values.\nAS/NZS 3000:2018\t456\nAPPENDIX\tC\nCIRCUIT ARRANGEMENTS\n(Informative)\nC1 SCOPE\nThis Appendix provides guidance on the following:\nDetermination of the circuit current for consumer mains, submains and final subcircuits.\nCable selection based on current-carrying capacity and voltage drop.\nCoordination of current ratings of circuit cables and protective devices.\nDivision of installation into circuits supplying single and multiple items  of equipment, as necessary, to provide satisfactory performance of circuits for the purpose intended.\nCable installation.\nThese are the factors that determine the arrangement of circuits in an installation that is deemed to meet the design, equipment selection and installation criteria of this Standard.\nC2\tMAXIMUM DEMAND\nC2.1\tAfter diversity maximum demand\nAs indicated in Clause 2.5.3, the current in a circuit is not permitted  to exceed the current rating of the circuit protective device, which, in turn, is  not permitted to exceed the current-carrying capacity of the circuit conductors.\nNOTE: Paragraph B3.2 of Appendix B explains further.\nFor circuits supplying a single item of equipment, the circuit current  is  simply the nominal load current of the equipment,  e.g.  a  10 000 W  230/400 V three-phase heater has a full per-phase load current of 14.5 A. The circuit conductors and the protective device are required to have a current-carrying capacity of not less than 16 A (nearest standard rating).\nWhere more than one item of equipment is connected, the circuit current could be assessed as the sum of the individual equipment load currents. While this would provide a safe and conservative solution, it does not take account of the normal operating conditions during which all  equipment  is  not operating simultaneously at  full load or for long periods, e.g. submains to a distribution board associated with numerous socket-outlet circuits.\nUnder such conditions, the circuit current is estimated using  diversity  factors and is often described as the \u2018after diversity maximum demand\u2019.\nThe diversity factors applicable to any given circuit in an installation will depend on a number of features of the installation including\u2014\nconditions under which the installation is expected to be used,\ne.g. residential compared with commercial;\noperating characteristics of the connected load, e.g.  airconditioning load in tropical locations compared with heating loads in cold-climate regions;\nnumber and physical distribution of points provided on the circuit,\ne.g. socket-outlets provided for convenient connection of portable equipment compared to dedicated or fixed equipment loads; and\nsize and type of significant loads, e.g. large motors or industrial plant.\nIt should be recognized that the determination of diversity factors given in  this Appendix will not be accurate for every installation and different installations of the same type may have significantly different load profiles which the designer needs to consider. The methods provided herein have been used over several editions of this Standard and, provided that care is taken to assess the presence of unusual equipment loads, are considered appropriate for many typical applications.\nWhen the load is assessed and the current-carrying capacity of the circuit is determined by allowing for diversity of operation of equipment, then the circuit should be protected by a circuit-breaker of rating to conform with Paragraph B3.2 of Appendix B.\nC2.2 Calculation of maximum demand in consumer mains and submains\nAs specified in Clause 2.2.2, maximum demand current may be determined by one of four methods\u2014calculation, assessment, measurement  or limitation. The following paragraphs provide information on and examples of the application of the calculation method for determining maximum demand current in consumer mains and submains only.\nC2.3\tDomestic installations C2.3.1\t\tMethod\nTable C1 provides an allocation of load for different types of equipment connected to consumer mains or submains in a single or multiple domestic installation. The load current is calculated for each equipment load group in the installation or affected part thereof, and these contributions are added together to achieve the maximum demand current. The  accompanying  notes provide clarification of certain provisions and the ensuing examples demonstrate how the calculation is made.\nTABLE\tC1\nMAXIMUM DEMAND\u2014SINGLE AND MULTIPLE DOMESTIC ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS\n(continued)\nAccessed by North Metropolitan TAFE on 29 Jun 2018 (Document currency not guaranteed when printed)\nTABLE\tC1\t(continued)\n(continued)\nTABLE\tC1\t(continued)\n*\nNOTES TO TABLE C1:\nSee Clause 2.2.2 for the circumstances where the maximum demand for consumer mains, submains, and final subcircuits, may be determined by assessment, measurement or limitation.\nFor multiphase connections, divide the number of living units by the number of supply phases, e.g. for 16 units on a three-phase supply, 16/3 = 6 units on the  heaviest loaded phase (Column 4).\nWhere only a portion of the number of units in a multiple domestic  electrical  installation is equipped with permanently connected or fixed appliances, such as electric cooking ranges or space heating equipment, the number  of  appliances  in each category is divided over the number of phases, and the maximum demand determined as shown in Paragraph C2.3.2.3.\nLighting track systems are regarded as two points per metre of track.\nA socket-outlet installed more than 2.3 m above a floor for the connection of a  luminaire may be included as a lighting point in load group (a)(i).\nAn appliance rated at not more than 150 W, which is permanently connected, or connected by means of a socket-outlet installed more than 2.3 m above  a  floor, may be included as a lighting point in load group (a)(i).\nIn the calculation of the connected load, the following ratings are assigned to lighting:\nIncandescent lamps 60 W or the actual wattage of the lamp to be installed, whichever is the greater, except if the design of the luminaire associated with the lampholder only permits lamps of less than 60 W to be inserted in any  lampholder, in which case, the connected load of that lampholder is the wattage of the highest rated lamp that may be accommodated. For multi-lamp luminaires, the load for each lampholder is assessed on the above basis.\nFluorescent and other discharge lamps Full connected load, i.e. the  actual current consumed by the lighting arrangement, including the losses of auxiliary equipment, such as ballasts and capacitors.\nLighting tracks (230 V) 0.5 A/m per phase of track or the actual connected load, whichever is the greater.\nFloodlighting, swimming pool lighting, tennis court lighting and the like.\nFor the purpose of determining maximum demand, a multiple combination socket- outlet is regarded as the same number of points as the number of integral socket- outlets in the combination.\nEach item of permanently connected electrical equipment not exceeding 10 A may be included in load group (b)(i) as an additional point.\nWhere an electrical installation contains 15 A or 20 A socket-outlets covered by load group (b)(ii) or (b)(iii), the base loading of load group (b) is increased by 10 A or 15 A respectively. If both 15 A and 20 A socket-outlets are installed, the increase is 15 A.\nWhere an electrical installation includes an airconditioning system for use in hot weather and a heating system for use in cool weather, only the system that has the greater load is taken into account.\nInstantaneous water heaters including \u2018quick recovery\u2019 heaters  having  element  ratings greater than 100 W/L.\nStorage-type water heaters, including  \u2018quick  recovery\u2019  heaters  not covered  by  Note 12.\nThis load group is not applicable to socket-outlets installed in communal areas but connected to  the individual living units. Such socket-outlets should be  included in   load group (b).\nCOPYRIGHT\nC2.3.2\tExamples of calculation\nNOTE: These examples were calculated assuming a supply voltage and  electrical equipment rating of 230 V.\nC2.3.2.1\tExample 1 Problem:\nTo determine the maximum demand of a single domestic electrical installation supplied at single-phase with the following load:", "metadata": {"clause_number": "2.5", "page": 62}}

The same ratings can be conservatively applied  to  New Zealand  conditions.\nSingle-circuit installation methods have been provided to keep the tables simple.

The Standard provides a comprehensive  set of tables and calculation methods taking into account different cable/conductor types, operating temperatures and installation methods.\nCOPYRIGHT\nThe basic formula used in the AS/NZS 3008.1 series is\u2014\nVd  = (L \uf0b4 I \uf0b4 Vc)/1000\t. . . C1\nwhere\nVd = actual voltage drop on circuit; in volts, V\nL\t= route length of circuit; in metres, m\nI\t= circuit current (usually maximum demand); in amperes, A\nVc = cable voltage drop per ampere-metre length of the circuit; in millivolts per ampere-metre, mV/Am\nValues of Vc are tabulated in the AS/NZS 3008.1 series.\nThis formula can be made simpler to apply by expressing the resulting voltage drop in percentage terms, as this allows for the percentage voltage on each section, i.e. consumer mains, submains and final subcircuits, to be added together, regardless of whether it is single-phase or three-phase. When the voltage drop in a circuit is expressed as a percentage of the  circuit operating voltage, the formula becomes\u2014\n%Vd  = (100/Vo) \uf0b4 (L \uf0b4 I \uf0b4 Vc)/1000\t. . . C2\n= (L \uf0b4 I \uf0b4 Vc)/(10 \uf0b4 Vo)\nwhere\n%Vd = actual voltage drop in circuit as a fraction of circuit-operating voltage; in percentage, %\nVo\t= circuit-operating voltage; in volts, V\nThe above formula can be also be rewritten in favour of the usual factors   that are known about a particular circuit. Its intended length and circuit- current as follows:\n(L \uf0b4 I)/%Vd = (10 \uf0b4 Vo)/Vc\nthe units of which may be expressed as Am per %Vd.\nTable C8 provides a simple tabulation of the terms (10 \uf0b4 Vo)/Vc developed using values for Vc from the AS/NZS 3008.1.1 series for common PVC/PVC cable types operating at 75\u00b0C, and 230 V and 400 V for single-phase and three-phase circuits respectively.\nWhere the conditions of route  length  and  circuit  current  are  known,  Table C7 may be used to determine\u2014\nthe required cable size for a specified percentage voltage drop in the circuit; and\nthe percentage voltage drop that a particular cable will provide.

While this Standard does not prescribe the installation of socket-outlets and lighting points on these circuits, the physical limitations of the terminals of these devices may make their connection impractical.\nFor the purposes of determining the number of points, a multiple combination of socket-outlets is regarded as the same number of points as the number of integral socket-outlets in the combination.\nA hotplate and oven are considered to  be one cooking appliance if mounted within  one room.\nMaximum demand is limited by the circuit-breaker on the final  subcircuit,  which  allows for diversity in operation of the range elements and hotplates.\nLighting points A luminaire is deemed to comprise one or more lighting points, according to the number of points at which it is connected by flexible cords to the installation wiring, or according to the number of sections in which it is switched or controlled. Connections of festoon lighting and decorative lighting are not regarded    as lighting points. See Table C1 for track systems and ELV lighting.\nA socket-outlet installed more than 2.3 m above a floor for the connection of a  luminaire may be included as a lighting point.\nAn appliance rated at not more than 150 W, which is permanently connected, or connected by means of a socket-outlet installed more than 2.3 m above  a  floor, may be included as a lighting point.\nApplies to circuits with 10 A socket-outlets connected where there are two or more circuits in an electrical installation.\nRestricted connections Table C9 precludes the connection of any socket-outlets on conductors having a cross-sectional area less than 2.5 mm2, except where they are used for the connection of a lighting point, or appliance rated at not more than 150 W and installed more than 2.3 m above a floor [see Note 6 above].\nThe values are intended to be utilized when the final subcircuit is provided for general use. Where it is known that socket-outlets may be used for specific items of electrical equipment, such as dishwashers, room heaters or clothes dryers, the actual load of the equipment should be substituted.\nFixed and stationary appliances may be connected permanently or through socket- outlets.\nAS/NZS 3000:2018\t486\nC6 GUIDE TO MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CABLES INSTALLED IN CONDUITS\nC6.1 General\nThis information is intended to be used as a guide for determining the number of cables and circuits that may be installed, without damage, in conduits and other forms of wiring enclosure.\nC6.2 Basis of calculations\nThe number of cables that can be installed in a circular conduit  is  determined from the ratios of the cross-sectional areas of the enclosure and the cable as follows:\nNumber of cables \uf03d internal cross-sectional areaof enclosure \uf0b4 space factor\ncross-sectional area of cable\nwhere the space factor recognizes the reduction of space available from the circular geometry of the cables and enclosures.\nFor one cable in enclosure\t0.5.\nFor two cables in enclosure\t0.33.\nFor three or more cables in enclosure\t0.4.\nTables C10 to C12 demonstrate the application of the equation for combinations of common conduit and cable types.\nC6.3 Application notes\nCable types and sizes used in Tables C10 to C12 are based on manufacturer\u2019s catalogue  nominal  sizes  for  cables  conforming  to  AS/NZS 5000.1 and AS/NZS 5000.2. For common building cable  types,  such as two-core and earth flat PVC/PVC V90 cables, the number of cables has increased because of the smaller cable dimensions of the 450/750 V rated cables.\nThe conduit sizes and types used in Tables C10 to C12 are based on nominal bore dimensions determined from AS/NZS 2053.2 (rigid UPVC), AS/NZS 2053.5 (corrugated) and AS/NZS 2053.6 (profile wall smooth bore).\nThe calculation method may also be applied to other combinations  of circular and non-circular enclosures, and cables of different types and sizes within the same enclosure, provided that the shape of the cables and enclosures are compatible.\nThe number of cables determined by the calculation assumes that the enclosure is relatively short in length, is clear of  obstructions  and distortions, and that the quantity and arrangement of impediments, such as bends, is minimized. Where this is not the case, the number  of  cables should be reduced and measures taken to ensure that the maximum cable pulling tension and bending radius are not exceeded.\nCOPYRIGHT\nThe calculation for the number of cables does not consider the effects of grouping cables on current-carrying capacity, temperature rise and voltage drop. AS/NZS 3008 provides de-rating factors for grouping that need to be considered in determining the suitability of circuits.\nTABLE\tC10\nGUIDE TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SINGLE-CORE SHEATHED CABLES INSTALLED IN CONDUIT\nPVC/PVC V90\nXLPE/PVC\nAccessed by North Metropolitan TAFE on 29 Jun 2018 (Document currency not guaranteed when printed)\nTABLE\tC11\nGUIDE TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TWO-CORE AND EARTH CABLES INSTALLED IN CONDUIT\nPVC/PVC V90\nPVC/PVC V75\nPVC/PVC V90 FLAT\nTABLE\tC12\nGUIDE TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FOUR-CORE AND EARTH CABLES INSTALLED IN CONDUIT\nPVC/PVC V90\nPVC/PVC V75\nXLPE/PVC\nAPPENDIX\tD\nMINIMUM SIZES OF POSTS, POLES AND STRUTS FOR AERIAL LINE CONDUCTORS\n(Informative)\nD1\tAPPLICATION\nD1.1\tGeneral\nThis Appendix sets out a series of tables, which provide information on the sinking depths and sizes of support structures for private aerial lines.\nThe information in the tables in this Appendix only applies to aerial  conductor sizes up to 2 \uf0b4 4 core 95 mm2 aluminium (Al) and 4 \uf0b4 7/3.5 mm2 copper (Cu) with a maximum total weight of 2.7 kg/m.\nNOTE: AS/NZS 7000 and its companion HB 331 can be used to determine support structures for conductor sizes and installation conditions not covered by these tables.\nThe following types of conductor support structures are covered by this Appendix:\nTimber posts and poles.\nSquare timber struts.\nAngle iron struts.\nSteel poles.\nSteel square section.\nFabricated steel poles.\nD1.2 Using the tables in this Appendix\nTable D2 gives the forces exerted by the aerial conductor line. This is a function of\u2014\nthe type of conductor being used;\nthe span length between supports; and\nthe design sag.\nThese factors combine to give the normal tension of an aerial conductor, in kilonewtons (kN). The last column of Table D2  indicates the minimum pole  or strut strength needed (S rating) to  support the normal load applied by  that tension.\nUsing this strength rating refer to Tables D3 to D13 to select the corresponding size of post, pole or strut. The  S rating  selected  from   Tables D3 to D13 has to be equal to or greater than the S rating derived  from Table D2.\nNOTES:\nThe free length to lowest conductor support shown in the tables is the distance between the lowest conductor support and\u2014\nthe ground for a pole or post; or\nthe closest fixing bolt on a structure for a strut.\nGalvanized steel-pipe posts with outside diameters  up  to  and  including  165 mm are Grade 250 steel water pipe commercially available in 6.5 m lengths. Posts specified with diameters of 168 mm have to be Grade 350 structural steel circular hollow sections, which may need to be specially ordered. Steel-pipe posts with a structural grade greater than 250 need to be clearly marked with their tested strength grade.\nD2\tGENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR POSTS AND POLES\nD2.1\tSinking of posts/poles in ground\nPosts/poles need to be securely set in the ground.\nIf the soil does not provide enough support, e.g. in built-up ground or soft soil, secure posts/poles either by setting them at a greater depth than normally necessary, or by using bearing blocks or shoes. Refer to Table D1 and the notes below.\nWhere, because of unusual circumstances, the butt of the post/pole cannot be sunk to the necessary depth in the ground, an alternative construction, such as flange mounting on a  reinforced concrete structure, may be used.  In such cases, the expertise of a  structural engineer is needed to ensure  that the mounting is suitable for the installation.\nThe length of the post/pole above ground needs to be assessed when selecting post/pole sizes to obtain necessary clearances.\nNOTES:\nThe free length to the lowest conductor support shown in Table D1 is the distance between the lowest conductor support and ground level.\nSoil quality\tSoil quality is defined according to AS/NZS 7000:\nPoor\tSoft clay, poorly compacted sand and soils that tend to absorb large amounts of water (150 kPa/m).\nMedium\tCompact medium clay, well-bonded sandy loam, bonded sand and gravel with reasonable surface water drainage (300 kPa/m).\nGood\tWell compacted rock soil, hard clay and well-bonded sand and gravel with good surface water drainage (600 kPa/m).\nPosts/poles set in concrete Where a post/pole is set in concrete, it needs to be located centrally in a hole with a size corresponding to a minimum diameter of 100 mm greater than the diameter of the post/pole.\nThe concrete should be finished as follows:\nFor a wooden post/pole\u2014not less than 250 mm below ground level.\nFor a steel post/pole\u2014100 mm above ground level and shaped to shed water.\nCOPYRIGHT\nSetting the post/pole in concrete is equivalent to improving the soil quality by one step, i.e. from \u2018poor\u2019 to \u2018medium\u2019 or from \u2018medium\u2019 to \u2018good\u2019. This corresponds to a reduction in the necessary sinking depth of the pole.\nThe post/pole should be left undisturbed for three days, or long enough to ensure that the concrete has developed adequate strength prior to attaching the aerial line.\nPosts/poles  set  in solid rock\tWhere a post/pole is set in solid rock, the depth in ground may be reduced by 0.3 m.\nD2.2\tTimber posts/poles\nTimber posts and poles need to be of untreated hardwood or timber with preservative treatment in accordance with AS 3818.11.\nTables D3 to D6 set out the minimum sizes of timber posts or poles of untreated hardwood timber with durability of Class 1 and 2 and strength rating of S3 or better.\nThe base of timber posts/poles and surrounding ground needs to be treated against insect and fungal attack by environmentally approved methods.\nTimber posts/poles need to be capped at the top to prevent water penetration.\nThe distance between the top anchor bolt and the top of  the  post/pole should not be less than 200 mm.\nD2.3\tSteel-pipe posts/poles\nThe necessary sizes/grades of steel-pipe posts/poles  are  set  out  in  Tables D7 to D13, with Figure D1 showing how the tables are applied.\nNOTE: Hollow steel poles need to be capped at the top to prevent water penetration.\nMaximum span for cable t ype and size (Table 3 . 9)\n\u22650. 2 m\nMaximum sag (Table D 2)\nMinimum pole/post length\n= minimum height above ground\n+ Maximum sag\n+ depth in ground\n+  0. 2 m\nPole/post size\nand strength rating ( Tables D3, D5, D 6 and D10 to D13)\nMinimum height above ground ( Table 3.8)\nFree length to lowest conductor suppor t\n( Tables D3, D5, D 6 and D10 to D13)\n= minimum height above ground\n+ maximum sag\nDepth in ground (Table D1)\nFIGURE  D1\tGUIDE TO SELECTION OF POLES/POSTS\nD3\tATTACHMENTS TO BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES\nD3.1\tResponsibility for design\nThe support needs to be designed and installed using sound engineering practice to withstand calculated forces in the direction of pull.

For 8 m/2 kN pole with the size reduced from the top, an S24 pole is needed. Note that a 2 kN pole may be used, as Table D2 Column 6 shows that, for this example, the nominal aerial tension is 1.35 kN.\nThus the pole needed is either an S23, 8 m  pole reduced from the   base to 6.90 m or an S24, 8 m pole reduced from the top to 6.90 m.\nIf Grade 250 steel pipe is selected, Table D10 shows that for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimum strength rating of S18, a pipe of 140 mm diameter \uf0b4 5.0 mm wall thickness is needed. This has an S20 rating.\nThus\tthe\tpost\tneeded\tis\ta\t6.90 m \uf0b4  140 mm \uf0c6  \uf0b4 5.0 mm\twall thickness (S20) Grade 250 steel pipe.\nIf Grade 350 steel pipe is selected, Table D11 shows that for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimum strength rating of S18, a pipe of 140 mm diameter and 3.5 mm wall thickness is needed. This has an S19 rating.\nThus the post needed is 6.90 m \uf0b4 140 mm \uf0c6 \uf0b4 3.5 mm wall thickness (S19) Grade 350 steel pipe.\nIf Grade 350 steel square section is selected, Table D12(B) shows that for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimum strength rating of S18, a post of 100 mm \uf0b4 100 mm \uf0b4 9 mm wall thickness is needed. This has an S20 rating.\nThus the post needed is 6.90 m \uf0b4 100 mm \uf0b4 100 mm \uf0b4 9.0 mm wall thickness (S20) Grade 350 steel section.\nIf Grade 450 steel square section is selected, Table D13(B) shows that for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimum strength rating of S18, there is no suitable size available.\nTABLE\tD1\nSINKING OF POSTS/POLES IN GROUND\nTABLE\tD2\nFORCE EXERTED BY AERIAL LINE CONDUCTORS\nSingle-phase insulated aerial lines\u2014Singles or twin twisted\nThree-phase insulated aerial lines\u2014Singles, twin twisted or bundled\nNOTES TO TABLE D2:\nMaximum allowable aerial line span (m) is limited to the  maximum  spans  shown  in Table 3.9 for the type of aerial conductor being used.\nMaximum allowable aerial line sag (m) has to be allowed for  when  determining  adequate clearances shown in Table 3.8.\nPoles, posts or support sizes for aerial conductor lines with a total weight greater than the values shown  in  Table D2  should  be  determined  by  individual  calculation.

Thus, reference to national construction codes is recommended for clarification of the application and any exceptions. National construction codes also contain a number of other provisions which relate to the design, selection and  installation  of equipment that forms part of an electrical installation, and which  are intended to satisfy objectives for safety, health, amenity, sustainability and energy efficiency.\nThis Appendix outlines the above provisions in order to inform the electrical industry and practitioners who work with AS/NZS 3000 of  measures  affecting electrical installations implemented under the National  Construction Code (NCC), for Australia, and the New Zealand  Building  Code (NZBC).\nE2\tAUSTRALIA\nE2.1\tGeneral\nThe NCC is written by the Australian Building Codes Board in conjunction with the building and plumbing authorities of the States and Territories. Its goals are nationally consistent health, safety, amenity and sustainability in building construction and plumbing and drainage.\nThe NCC is adopted under building and plumbing construction legislation in Australian States and Territories, which have responsibility for building construction and plumbing and drainage installations. The NCC is implemented through building certifiers, both local government and private, and other professional practitioners.\nThe NCC is in three volumes:\nVolume One\u2014Building Code of Australia Class 2 to Class 9 Buildings (for multi-residential, commercial, industrial and public buildings and structures).\nVolume\tTwo\u2014Building\tCode\tof\tAustralia\tClass 1\tand\tClass 10 Buildings (for houses and associated structures).\nVolume\tThree\u2014Plumbing\tCode\tof\tAustralia\t(for\tplumbing\tand drainage associated with all classes of buildings).\nCOPYRIGHT\nThe NCC is performance-based and contains fundamental \u2018performance requirements\u2019 together with acceptable solutions, known as \u2018deemed-to- satisfy provisions\u2019, often based on compliance with Standards.\nThe ABCB also produces a Handbook, NCC Volume One Energy Efficiency Provisions. The Handbook, which is available free from the ABCB website (www.abcb.gov.au), has been developed to alert electricians and plumbers  to the energy efficiency provisions of the NCC and how these provisions  may affect them.\nE2.2\tPrinciples of classification\nE2.2.1\tGeneral\nThe classification of a building or part of a building is determined by the purpose for which it is designed, constructed or adapted to be used.\nNOTE: Paragraphs E2.2.2, E2.2.3 and E2.2.4 are extracts of  Clauses A3.1, A3.2, A3.3 and A3.4 of the National Construction Code 2016, Volume One, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence \u00a9 2016 Commonwealth of Australia and States and Territories of Australia.

The result of a risk assessment will determine the need for both structural and surge protection. If structural protection is installed, primary surge protection, at least, is also required.\nThis Appendix does not consider surge protective components that may be incorporated into appliances connected to the electrical installation. The presence of  such components may modify the behaviour of  the main SPD of the electrical installation and may need additional coordination.\nF1.2 Selection and installation of SPDs F1.2.1\tLocation\nPrimary SPDs are installed near the origin of the electrical installation or at the main switchboard.\nCOPYRIGHT\nSecondary SPDs are installed at switchboards remote from the main switchboard. Secondary SPDs should be coordinated with the  primary SPDs in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nWhere\tpremises\tcontain\tsensitive\telectronic\tequipment,\tadditional protection at the equipment may also be warranted.\nTelecommunications, remote telemetry and industrial process control sites require special attention. AS/NZS 1768 provides further information.\nF1.2.2\tInstallation\nSPDs should be\u2014\ninstalled after the main switch but prior to any RCD devices. Where    the main switch is an RCD, refer to Paragraph F2.4;\nprotected by an appropriate fuse or circuit-breaker separate from the SPD;\nconnected at the main switchboard between phase and neutral;\nNOTE: Figure F1 shows a typical connection of a primary SPD for a single-phase installation.\nconnected at switchboards remote from the main switchboard and without MEN connection, from each phase to neutral and from neutral  to earth;\nNOTE: Figure F2 shows a typical installation of a secondary SPD for a single-phase installation.\nbe legibly and permanently labelled as to their function, in accordance with Clause 2.10.5.1; and\nwhere alarmed to provide status indication, fail safe in operation.\nAS/NZS 1768 provides further details on the selection of primary and secondary SPDs.\nMain switch\nSupply\tFuse\nCB\tRCD\nSPD\nNeutral bar MEN connection\nEar th bar\nLoads\nEar th\nelectrode\nFIGURE  F1\tTYPICAL PRIMARY SPD AT MAIN SWITCHBOARD\nMain switch\nFrom MEN connection\nFuse\nCB\tCB\nRCD\nNeutral bar\nLoads\nEar th bar\nNOTE: This configuration, with an integrated gas discharge tube connected from neutral to earth, is most commonly used and provides protection for all modes of disturbance.\nFIGURE  F2\tTYPICAL SECONDARY SPD AT DISTRIBUTION BOARD\nCOPYRIGHT\nF1.2.3 Selection of surge protection devices (SPDs)\nFor most domestic  supplies  in  urban  environments,  a  surge  rating  of  Imax = 40 kA per phase for an 8/20 \uf06ds impulse and a maximum working voltage of 275 V a.c. to 320 V a.c. is suitable.\nIn the case of installations in exposed locations in high lightning areas, with long overhead service lines, or industrial and commercial premises, it  may be prudent to install SPDs with a higher surge rating (typically 100 kA per phase for an 8/20 \uf06ds impulse).\nF1.2.4 Overcurrent protective devices\nSPDs should be protected against short-circuit by suitable overcurrent protective devices. In accordance with Clause 2.5.2, the short-circuit withstand of the SPD, together with the overcurrent protective device,  should be not less than the prospective short-circuit current at the point of installation.\nThe current rating of the SPD overcurrent protective device should be\u2014\nas recommended by the SPD manufacturer but not greater than the manufacturer\u2019s declared maximum backup fuse rating; and\nless than the rating of the immediate upstream protective device.\nNOTE: Notwithstanding the above, the following current ratings of HRC fuses or circuit-breakers are suitable for typical domestic applications, such as households:", "metadata": {"clause_number": "0.20", "page": 70}}
{"content": "63 A for a 100 kA SPD.\nIf an SPD is installed on the load side of an RCD, the RCD should have a breaking capacity of not less than 3 kA. S-type RCDs, in accordance with AS/NZS 61008.1 and AS/NZS 61009.1 are deemed to satisfy this recommendation.\nF1.2.5 Connecting conductors\nConductors used to connect an SPD to both the line, via the overcurrent protective device, and to the main earthing or neutral conductor should be consistent with the current rating of the backup fuse or circuit-breaker but should be not less than 6 mm2, be as short and direct as  possible and with no loops.\nThe total conductor length between the two points of connection including both   active   and   earth/neutral   should   be   less   than   1 m   (ideally   300 mm\u2013600 mm) overall.\nA connection to the neutral conductor should be as close as practicable to the MEN link.\nF2\tSURGE PROTECTIVE EARTHING AND BONDING\nWhere conductive telecommunications conductors and equipment are employed, overvoltage protection may be required at buildings to prevent injury to people and to prevent damage to equipment. An example of  how an injury can occur is shown in Figure F3 below.\nFIGURE  F3\tEXAMPLE OF HOW A TRANSIENT DEVELOPS A HAZARDOUS VOLTAGE DIFFERENCE IN A BUILDING\nA transient overvoltage on the powerline may result in a high surge current  to earth via the MEN link in the electrical switchboard. This momentarily raises the local earth potential typically by tens of thousands of volts. Thus, any object connected to the local earth, e.g. earthed electrical appliances, such as the refrigerator shown, metallic plumbing, concrete floor slab, etc., will momentarily be raised in potential.\nTo minimize the cost of installing overvoltage protection at domestic premises, all conductive services should enter the building as close as practicable to the main earth bar. To be effective the conductor from the telecommunications primary protection SPD to the main earth bar should be", "metadata": {"clause_number": "63", "page": 71}}
{"content": "1.5 m or less in length.\nBonding of metallic services, such as gas and water pipes, and conductive objects, e.g. concrete floors and metallic walls, etc. is recommended.\nPrimary protection for telecommunication lines is provided by a gas discharge tube type SPD. At domestic premises, this is preferably installed  in a wall box near the electrical switchboard and connected to  the main earth bar. Figure F4 shows this connection in the protector housing.\nA special need exists for earthing of conductive telecommunications equipment. Current standards require a hard-wired earth for some equipment. There is a range of services which need to be bonded to the  main earth bar via the telecommunications earth, e.g. telecommunications SPDs and cable screens, antennas, CATV, etc.\nSome electrical installation practices make access to the earth  electrode  and earthing conductor difficult. To achieve the necessary short telecommunication bonding conductor, a bonding bar or terminal external to the main switchboard and mounted outside the meter box or electrical switchboard on an outside wall is recommended for domestic installations.    It will assist telecommunications carriers if the bonding bar or terminal is provided when the switchboard is installed.\nThis method is detailed in AS/CA S009 and is shown below in Figure F4.\nElectrical switchboard\tEquipotential bond to MEB\nvia a bonding bar or terminal Main ear thing bar or terminal\nProtector housing\nEquipotential bonding point\n<1. 5 metres preferred\nBonding bar or terminal\n(Communications Ear th Terminal - CET)\nBonding conductor\nEar th electrode\nMain ear thing conductor\nNOTE: The main ear thing conductor should be shor t and direct (no loops or coils)\nFIGURE  F4\tPREFERRED METHOD OF BONDING THE PRIMARY TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROTECTOR TO THE MAIN EARTH\nAPPENDIX\tG\nDEGREES OF PROTECTION OF ENCLOSED EQUIPMENT\n(Informative)\nThe degree of ingress protection of an item of enclosed equipment is expressed  as  an  IP  (Ingress  Protection)   rating,   in   accordance   with AS 60529.\nThe \u2018IP\u2019 rating is usually written as \u2018IP\u2019 followed by two numbers and, sometimes, an additional letter.\nThe first number, from 1 to 6, designates a degree of \u2018protection against  solid objects\u2019, and \u2018protection of persons against access to  hazardous  parts\u2019.\nThe second number, from 1 to 8, designates a degree of \u2018protection against entry of water with harmful effects\u2019.\nIf a specific degree of protection is not designated, an \u2018X\u2019 is used instead of either one or both numbers.\nThe additional letter, from A to D, when used, designates a degree of \u2018protection of persons against access to hazardous parts\u2019.\nAS/NZS 60947.3:2015, Annex D, refers to an IP56NW rating for switch disconnectors within enclosures; this is required in AS/NZS 5033 PV Installations. \u2018NW\u2019 is in reference to no water entry into the enclosure.

Wiring systems, comprising cable, busway, support, fixing and enclosure elements are classified in accordance with the ability of the complete system to\u2014\nmaintain circuit integrity under fire conditions for a specified  period;  and\nmaintain circuit integrity against mechanical damage of specified  severity.\nNOTE: Elements of a wiring system may need replacement after exposure to a hazard.\nThis Appendix applies only to wiring systems that are in all other respects safe and suitable for their intended use and comply  with  relevant Standards.\nThe use of wiring systems tested in accordance with AS/NZS 3013 may not be necessary where elements of building construction provide satisfactory protection against the effects of fire and mechanical damage.\nNOTE: The degree of protection against fire  and  mechanical damage required of a wiring system depends on the application. To determine specific requirements, reference should be made to Standards dealing with a particular application (see Paragraph H2).\nH1.2\tDesignation H1.2.1\t\tGeneral\nThe basic designation used to indicate the ability of a wiring system to maintain circuit integrity under fire conditions for a specified period and to maintain circuit integrity against mechanical damage of specified severity consists of a code of four characters.\nH1.2.2\tBasic designation\nThe designation consists of the following characters:\nThe characteristic letters \u2018WS\u2019 (wiring system).\nFollowed\tby\ta\tfirst\tcharacteristic\tnumeral,\twhere\tapplicable (see Paragraph H1.3).\nCOPYRIGHT\nFollowed\tby\ta\tsecond\tcharacteristic\tnumeral,\twhere\tapplicable (see Paragraph H1.4).\nA supplementary  letter  W,  which  may  be  added  when  required  (see Paragraph H1.5).\nH1.2.3\tSingle characteristic numeral designation\nWhere a class of protection is indicated by only one characteristic numeral, the letter X is used in the position normally occupied by the omitted characteristic numeral, e.g. WSX5 or WS2X.\nH1.3\tFirst characteristic numeral\nThe first characteristic numeral represents the time for which the wiring system is able to maintain circuit integrity under specified fire conditions.\nTable H1 gives the minimum time the wiring system needs  to  maintain circuit integrity, when tested in accordance with AS/NZS 3013, in order to   be assigned the associated characteristic numeral.\nTABLE\tH1\nDEGREE OF PROTECTION INDICATED BY THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC NUMERAL\nDegree of protection indicated by the first characteristic numeral (Protection against exposure to fire)\nH1.4\tSecond characteristic numeral\nThe second characteristic numeral represents the degree of mechanical impact and cutting load to which the wiring system can be subjected without losing circuit integrity.\nTable H2 indicates the degree of impact for which the wiring system needs  to maintain circuit integrity when tested in accordance with AS/NZS 3013.\nTABLE\tH2\nDEGREE OF PROTECTION INDICATED\nBY THE SECOND CHARACTERISTIC NUMERAL\nDegree of protection indicated by the second characteristic numeral (Protection against mechanical damage)\nH1.5\tSupplementary letter W\nThe addition of the supplementary letter W to a wiring system designation means that the wiring system is able to maintain circuit integrity when\u2014\ntested for protection against exposure to fire for the period specified   by the first characteristic numeral; and\nthen hosed with water. H1.6\t\tSupply and installation H1.6.1\t\tComponents\nAll components of a wiring system assigned a  particular  classification should comply with AS/NZS 3013.\nH1.6.2\tInstructions\nWiring system suppliers should provide installers with complete, concise details of methods of fixing and support for the wiring system required to achieve its classification in accordance with AS/NZS 3013, including instructions on the correct orientation of the wiring system.\nInstallers should install wiring systems strictly in accordance with the supplier\u2019s instructions. Substitution of appropriately tested supports and fixings of equivalent or greater classification and load capacity are acceptable.\nH2\tPARTICULAR WIRING SYSTEM APPLICATIONS\nH2.1\tBuilding Code\nThe Building Code of Australia (NCC Volume 1) requires wiring systems supplying a substation or main switchboard, that supplies equipment\nCOPYRIGHT\nrequired to operate in an emergency mode, to have a wiring system rating of\u2014\nWS53W, if located in a position subject to damage by motor vehicles;\nWS52W, elsewhere; or\notherwise\tenclosed\tor\tprotected\tby\tconstruction\thaving\ta fire-resistance level of not less than120/120/120.\nH2.2\tEquipment installation Standards\nStandards that include requirements for wiring systems with fire or mechanical protection include, without limitation, the following:\nAS/NZS 1668.1, The use of ventilation and  airconditioning  in  buildings,  Part 1: Fire and smoke control in buildings, requires a wiring system rating  of WS5X for circuits supplying equipment required to operate in a smoke-control mode.\nAS 1670.1, Fire detection, warning, control and intercom systems\u2014System design, installation and commissioning, Part 1: Fire, requires a  wiring  system mechanical rating of WSX2 for signal circuits and WS51W for fire rated circuits, e.g. incoming telcommunications connection, associated with fire detection and alarm system signals.\nAS 1670.4, Fire detection, warning, control and intercom systems\u2014System design, installation and commissioning, Part 4: Sound systems  and  intercom systems for emergency purposes, requires a wiring system rating  of WS51W for intercom and sound system equipment circuits between fire compartments.\nAS 2118 series, Automatic fire sprinkler systems.\nAS 2118.1, Automatic fire sprinkler systems, Part 1: General systems, requires a wiring system rating of WS51W for certain alarm signalling circuits.\nAS or AS/NZS 2293 series, Emergency escape lighting and exit signs for buildings.\nAS 2293.1, Emergency escape lighting and exit signs for buildings, Part 1: System design, installation and operation, requires a rating of WS4X for submains and certain circuits associated with central emergency lighting systems.\nAS 2941, Fixed fire protection installations\u2014Pumpset systems, requires a wiring system rating of\u2014\nWS2X for circuits for residential sprinkler electric pumpsets; and\nWS5X for circuits for hydrant and hose reel electric pumpsets.\nNZS 4512, Fire detection and alarm systems in buildings, requires a wiring system rating of\u2014\nWS11 for incoming telecommunications connection; and\nCOPYRIGHT\nWS51W for intercom and  sound system equipment circuits between  fire compartments.\nH3\tFIRE-PROTECTED WIRING SYSTEMS\nA wiring system can be provided with protection against exposure to fire in the following two ways:\nThe use of unenclosed or enclosed wiring systems classified in accordance with AS/NZS 3013 and not depending on fire-rated elements of building construction for thermal protection.\nThe use of fire-rated elements of building construction to provide thermal protection to wiring systems not complying with the requirements of AS/NZS 3013 for the degree of protection required.\nH4\tMECHANICALLY PROTECTED WIRING SYSTEMS\nH4.1\tGeneral\nMechanical protection is provided to prevent accidental damage.\nAccordingly, the approach should involve the provision of a  protection system with the minimum number of protrusions that are likely to catch or cause damage to vehicles or injury to persons. At the same time, the mechanical protection system needs to provide adequate mechanical protection to prevent damage by contact with vehicles or persons.\nIn the installation of these systems, a primary consideration should be that, where possible, the wiring system location should be chosen to restrict or to prevent the approach of any object likely to cause damage. Generally, this may be in protected corners or in some area away from the traffic that may cause the damage. Where such a location is not possible, further protection is to be provided.\nWiring systems can be\u2014\nunenclosed (where the protection is an integral part of the cable or busway); or\nenclosed (where a protective cover is provided outside the wiring system).\nThe impact and cutting energies for the various classification levels are specified in AS/NZS 3013.\nNon-metallic materials may be expected to provide mechanical protection over a temperature range of \uf02d15\u00b0C to +60\u00b0C. The manufacturer may certify extended or reduced ranges that should be externally marked on the protection system.\nH4.2\tApplication of wiring systems\nWiring systems that maintain their circuit integrity under conditions of mechanical damage may be used as indicated below. The following\nCOPYRIGHT\nexamples are general indications only because the frequency and level of impact in any particular application is difficult to determine:\nWSX1\tIn internal domestic or office situations where some damage is considered likely.\nWSX2\tIn passageways in domestic, office and commercial locations where impact by hand trucks and barrows is considered likely.\nWSX3\tIn car parks and driveways where occasional impact of cars or light vehicles is possible.\nWSX4\tIn areas where impact by vehicles not exceeding two tonnes but with solid frames is likely.\nWSX5\tIn areas where impact by  laden  trucks exceeding two tonnes is likely.\nNOTES:\nClassified wiring systems are tested to withstand the above impact conditions. However, repeated impacts of these levels could lead to failure  of the wiring system.\nImpact energies for the higher classification are severe so that every effort should be made to avoid routing wiring through such areas.\nH4.3\tUnenclosed wiring systems\nFor unenclosed wiring systems, mechanically protected cables  and  busways complying with the requirements of AS/NZS 3013 should be selected. All components used in such wiring systems should be  tested to be in accordance with the appropriate requirements of AS/NZS 3013.\nH4.4\tEnclosed wiring systems\nThe following recommendations apply to enclosed wiring systems:\nIf mechanical protection of the wiring system is achieved by an additional enclosure, the protection may be in the form of\u2014\na complete enclosure, such as a conduit, pipe, trunking or other housing; or\na barrier that is interposed between the wiring system and the possible source of impact.\nIn both cases, the protection needs to be capable of resisting  the impact load.\nIf cables are contained in conduit or piping, such enclosure should be type tested for the impact energy and ambient temperature range  of  the location in which it is installed.\nIf cables are installed in a cable trunking, on a  cable tray with covers,  or in a similar manner, the enclosure should be type tested.\nEnclosed wiring systems for Classifications WSX1, WSX2 and WSX3 should be type-tested. While wiring systems for Classifications WSX4 and WSX5 can be type-tested, it is anticipated that these enclosures  will be designed by a structural engineer.\nH5\tGUIDE TO MECHANICAL PROTECTION CLASSIFICATION\nH5.1\tGeneral\nThe systems given in Paragraphs H5.2, H5.3 and H5.4 will generally  provide the mechanical protection required for the classification  under  which they are listed.\nH5.2\tWSX1 mechanical protection systems\nProvide light-duty protection against casual damage by pedestrians as follows:\nWiring systems meeting requirements of the appropriate tests of AS/NZS 3013.\nOne sheathed cable immediately adjacent to a projecting timber batten or similar corner so that the projection is not less than twice the dimension of the cable in that direction.

{"content": "1.89 kV.\nK6.8\tCurrent rating by testing and temperature limits\nClause 10.10 and Table 6 of AS/NZS 61439.1:2016  provide  current- carrying capacity requirements that are to be  satisfied by  rated current of the switchboard ASSEMBLY (InA), rated current of outgoing circuits (Inc),  and maximum demand after diversity factor (RDF).  These  requirements may meet the requirements of this Standard.\nThis test from AS/NZS 61439.1 establishes the following:\nThat InA is the rated current of the ASSEMBLY and the current that the busbar is capable of distributing, for example, InA = 1600 A.\nThat Inc is the maximum rated current of an individual circuit, for example, Inc = 534 A for a MCCB marked In 630 A.\nNOTE: The In marked rating, that is tested to AS/NZS 60947.2 in free air, may differ (need derating) to achieve Inc. That is, Inc of 534 A is equal to 0.85 multiplied by In of 630 A.\nThat RDF (rated diversity factor), for example\u2014\nI = 0.9 \uf0b4 Inc\n= 0.9 \uf0b4 534\n= 481 A per circuit\nwhere\nRDF= 0.9 for three outgoing circuits.\nThus,\tthe\ttotal\tcurrent\tafter\tdiversity\tfor\tthe\tthree circuits = 3 \uf0b4 481 = 1443 A.\nAnother example\u2014\nI = Inc = 481 per circuit; and\nRDF = 1 for three outgoing circuits\nThus,\tthe\ttotal\tcurrent\tafter\tdiversity\tfor\tthe\tthree circuits = 3 \uf0b4 481 = 1443 A.\nNOTES:\nRDF is the per unit value of the rated current, assigned by the ASSEMBLY manufacturer, to which outgoing circuits of an ASSEMBLY can be continuously and simultaneously loaded, taking into account the mutual thermal influences.\nRDF should be equal to or higher than the value of assumed loading  factor     from     Table 101      of      AS/NZS 61439.2:2016      and AS/NZS 61439.3:2016.\nFor example, an assumed loading factor for three circuits,  In = 0.9,   Table 101\tof\tAS/NZS 61439.2:2016\tand\tIn = 0.8\tTable 101\tof\nAS/NZS 61439.3.\nFor guidance and examples, refer to AS/NZS 61439.1:2016, Annex E, Paragraph E2.\nThe assumed loading factor from Table 101  of  AS/NZS 61439.2:2016 and after diversity maximum demand from Appendix C, Paragraph C2 of this Standard are the same in principle.\nThe derating influences for current ratings for InA, Inc and RDF.\nIn is the marked current rating on a device tested in free air. The air temperature rise inside the switchboard is higher than the outside ambient temperature and depends on the heating from  equipment, such as busbars, circuit-breakers and fuses. Tests for Inc and RDF are with the ASSEMBLY carrying InA. The ventilation and the IP  rating affect the inside air temperature rise. The minimum IP rating for a PSC ASSEMBLY is IP2X and for a DBO is IP2XC. For example, a rating of IP5X will need to be derated if the original test was at IP2X.

Household automation plays a large part in this.\nM1.3\tHomecare medical\nHome-based medical procedures such as dialysis, respiratory support and cardiac care are becoming commonplace. Allied to  this is  the growing use  of tele-monitoring, which is the remote collection and transmission of  data  so that it can be interpreted and used for ongoing patient management.\nM2\tARRANGEMENTS\nThe following steps are provided to supplement the requirements of this Standard for active assisted living and homecare medical applications:\nEnrol the electrical installation for the priority restoration in the event    of supply failure with the electricity retailer and/or electricity distributor providing the power supply to the electrical installation.\nEnsure that all trees have sufficient clearance from the aerial conductors to prevent damage to, or the interruption of the electrical supply, if the supply to the electrical installation is by aerial\nconductors. Further inspections should be carried out at appropriate intervals and corrective action taken, if required.\nProvide  full  discrimination  throughout  the   electrical   installation  (see Clause 2.5.7).\nEnsure that the capacity of  the consumer mains, switchboards and  final subcircuit wiring is able to supply the expected maximum loading  of the electrical installation.\nUse miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) or residual current breaker with overload (RCBO) for overcurrent protection in  domestic installations,  as they require no additional parts to carry out repair. A MCB or RCBO is able to be reset easily without live terminals being exposed. They  also give a visual indication that they have tripped, making  identification and restoration a simple process.\nUse a portable Type 1, 10 mA RCD for each item  of  medical equipment in home care areas of a domestic electrical installation. These RCDs enable the use of another operating socket-outlet to maintain supply in the event of a switchboard mounted MCB or RCD tripping;\nEnsure constant charging of the batteries to maintain full charge for power supply equipment fitted with batteries as energy storage.  Regular maintenance of the batteries should be carried out to the battery manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\nNOTE: The maintenance of batteries fitted to medical equipment to provide continued operation in the event of power supply failure is considered to be part of the medical equipment maintenance arrangements.\nProvide for an easy connection of a portable generating set (located outside due to the generating set exhaust gases and combustion and cooling air requirements) by use of an extension cord, dedicated socket-outlet wiring in the electrical installation or changeover switch  for the connection to the electrical installation. These are typical methods that can be used to cover extended period of supply failure.\nNOTES:\nA grid connected inverter is not able to use the output from a PV array when the normal mains supply to the electrical installation has failed.\nAn inverter or UPS powered from a large battery may be  able to provide an alternative power supply cover for a short term supply failure.\nPut in place arrangements to cater for medical evacuation to a suitable site which is able to provide a long term alternative power supply.\n*\tAPPENDIX\tN\nELECTRICAL CONDUITS\n(Informative)\nN1\tGENERAL\nThere are two series of Standards for electrical conduits that run in parallel within Australia and New Zealand.\nThe first is the AS/NZS 2053 series and the second is the AS/NZS 61386 series, which is based on but not equivalent to the IEC 61386 series.\nThe relevant Standards are as follows:\nAS/NZS\n2053\tConduits and fittings for electrical installations\nN2\tMARKING OF AS/NZS 2053 SERIES AND AS/NZS 61386 SERIES CONDUITS\nThe following marking applies:\nAll conduits marked with the manufacturer\u2019s name or trade mark.\nAll conduits marked with the nominal size.\nAll conduits marked with the word \u2018electrical\u2019.\nBoth series allow the marking of the duty rating\u2014VLD, LD, MD, HD, VHD.\nAS/NZS 61386 series conduits may be marked with four numbers, as    a minimum, to identify the classifications applicable.

CIRCUIT PROTECTION APPLICATION GUIDE\n(Informative)\nQ1 SCOPE\nThis Appendix provides guidance for the selection of circuit protection and switching devices operated on a d.c. supply that would be deemed to meet the design, equipment selection and installation criteria of this Standard.\nQ2 GENERAL\nWhere a single contact is used to interrupt the current flow of a d.c. circuit, consideration should be given to the size of the contact, the air gap, arc suppression and the use of multiple contacts.\nQ3 ARC SUPPRESSION\nWhen a contact carrying d.c. current is opened, an arc is formed between each set of contacts as they are opened, and to increase the resistance of the arc and to reduce the current flow to zero as quickly as possible, an arc chute for each set of contacts is used to increase the length of the arc, cool the arc and to increase the arc resistance until the current flowing  is  reduced to zero.\nIn some devices, but not all, the use of a permanent magnet in each arc chute assembly is used to assist in drawing of the arc into the arc chute to increase the length and resistance of the arc until the current flow  is  reduced to zero.\nQ4 SWITCHGEAR TYPES\nQ4.1 Polarized\nWhen the d.c. load current can flow in only one direction in normal or fault conditions, the use of polarized devices is possible.\nPolarized devices are fitted with a permanent magnet to assist in the magnetic deflection of the arc into the switchgear arc chute to increase the arc length when the device contacts are opening. To be able to perform this deflection function, the magnetic field in the load-carrying parts of  the  device should be such that the magnetic field of the magnet is arranged for the maximum deflection force. The correct external polarity connections of the device will ensure correct operation of the arc deflection forces.\nA typical application of a polarized overcurrent device is a distribution switchboard providing a supply to d.c. operated equipment. This configuration will only allow load current to flow in one direction.\nCOPYRIGHT\nQ4.2\tNon-polarized type\nWhen it is possible that the d.c. load current could flow in either direction in normal or fault conditions, the use of non-polarized devices is necessary.\nAs the d.c. current is able to flow in two directions, this means a magnetic field from a fixed magnet is not able to be used.\nA typical application use of a non-polarized type device is a battery overcurrent device in which the current flow can be in two  different directions; the battery charge current when being float charged, and the battery when being discharged by the load and when no output from the\nd.c. charging source is available.\nQ5\tD.C. RATINGS\nQ5.1\tGeneral\nAll d.c. isolating switches, contactors and overcurrent devices should be identified as being suitable for operation on a d.c. supply. The maximum current and voltage ratings specified by the manufacturer should not be exceeded and the multiple series contact arrangement detailed in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions should be used.\nFor operating voltages above 60 V d.c. (ELV) this will usually  require the  use of two or more contacts in series to achieve the specified operating voltage and current ratings.\nQ5.2\tEarthed D.C. supply\nThe d.c. supply may be operated as a separated (isolated) supply. All switching or overload devices should operate in  all unearthed conductors;  all multi-pole devices should be linked together so that all contacts will operate substantially together.\nOne pole of the d.c. supply may be earthed. Any switching device may operate in the unearthed conductor only.\nException: A multi-pole device is permitted in all conductors (including the earthed conductor) in this application. All contacts should be linked together so that all contacts operate substantially together.\nQ6\tPROVISION OF ISOLATION AND OVERCURRENT PROTECTION\nThe applicable requirements of Sections 2 to 7 of  this Standard apply for  the provision of isolation and overcurrent protection of the d.c. system.\nException: Earth leakage protection by use of RCDs is not required, as no suitable protection devices are currently available.\nQ7\tSWITCHBOARD LOCATIONS\nClause 2.10 of this Standard specifies requirements for the location of switchboards containing a main switch and overcurrent devices.\nQ8\tFINAL SUBCIRCUIT WIRING AND FITTINGS\nAll wiring for the direct current system should be suitable for use on a d.c. supply. Installation requirements are specified in Sections 3 and 4 of this Standard.\nIf twin cables are not used, all single cables should be positioned in close proximity of each other to provide cancellation of the magnetic field when\ncurrent is flowing.\nSegregation of 25 mm minimum should be maintained from all  d.c.  cabling to the a.c. wiring in switchboards and cabling within the installation.\nThe use of fittings designed solely for use on LV a.c. electrical installations only should not be used for d.c. installations.\nAll d.c. socket-outlets should be provided with a d.c. rated control switch.\nThe plugs of a.c. operated equipment should not be able to enter socket- outlets connected to the d.c. distribution system, or vice versa.\nQ9\tINVERTERS\nIf the d.c. supply system has an inverter providing a 230 V a.c.  supply output, unless the inverter a.c. output is not permanently marked as  providing full electrical isolation from the d.c. input to the a.c. output, all parts of the d.c. supply system should be insulated and  screened  from touch for 230 V a.c. operation.\nNOTES:\nAn inverter which does not provide for full electrical isolation between the\nd.c. input and a.c. output, is considered to be a \u2018transformer-less\u2019 or a \u2018non- isolated\u2019 design, and under some fault conditions can result in the  d.c.  supply being raised to the potential of the a.c. output.\nFor a.c. only switch contacts and overcurrent device contacts, all contacts have a small air gap to ensure the a.c. arc supply current through the load current drops down to zero, twice for every cycle of the supply voltage until the arc is extinguished. The breaking of d.c. supply current, which will draw an arc across the switch\u2019s opening contacts, requires that the arc increase in resistance until the current no longer flows (may be effected by increasing the length of the arc by the action of magnetic blow-out arcing contacts). Any\na.c. only switch used in such circumstances on a  d.c. supply will be unable to sufficiently increase the resistance of the continuous arc across its contacts; the likely result will be that the arcing will continue until the switch contacts are destroyed.\nCOPYRIGHT\nINDEX\nA\nabnormal voltages\nSee also overvoltage protection protection against 1.5.11.1\ncircuits operating at different
